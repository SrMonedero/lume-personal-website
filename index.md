## Quique Álvarez Monedero

My name is Quique _/Kee-Keh/_. I'm a software engineer.

I'm part of [The Left Bit](https://www.theleftbit.com) and [Semantico](https://semantico.ai).

I also co-created this non existing project [BeWelhome](https://bewelhome.com/) consisting of a landing and lots of conversations 🍺 around the product we could/would do.

Once a year I help [LaGuiaDeMI](https://laguiademi.com) to maintain their website, it takes me 10 minutes every year.

Say [👋](mailto:hola@quique.info).
